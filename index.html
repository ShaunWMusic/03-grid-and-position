          Meh. I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool. I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring. Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial?
          What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food. Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.
          Ow, my spirit! Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? Actually, that's still true. One hundred dollars. All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school!
